   \note{Hi. My name is Socrates.  I will be teaching this course.  
I know everything.  You know nothing.  Watch and learn as best as your 
tiny brain can.  I already know that 90\% of you will fail.  The other 
10\% are worthless, but will pass.  That's life.  Get used to it.}

   \note{Here are some more insulting comments that I wish to make.  
The class will not see them on the overhead, but I will see them on my 
laptop.}

      \begin{itemize}
         \item Instructor:
            \begin{itemize}
               \item Me---Socrates.  You can call me God, 
but that might confuse some of the people that don't know that I'm God.
            \end{itemize}
         \item Teaching Assistants:
            \begin{itemize}
               \item Knuckleduster O'McFlanagan
               \item Alfarero Peludo
            \end{itemize}
         \item The TAs will fail at their jobs.
         \item So will you, but that won't be their fault.
      \end{itemize}
      \note{I'll be in my office, but don't ever bother me.  
I will bite your head off.  At best, I'll roll my eyes, brush you off, 
and fail to answer your questions.}
